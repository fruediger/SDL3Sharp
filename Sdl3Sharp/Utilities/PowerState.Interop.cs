	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// You should never take a battery status as absolute truth. Batteries (especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the values reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports.
	/// It's not uncommon for older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it reports, or completely drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned with power state, you should call this function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes until they seem to be stable for a few seconds.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// It's possible a platform can only report battery percentage or time left but not both.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// On some platforms, retrieving power supply details might be expensive.
	/// If you want to display continuous status you could call this function every minute or so.
	/// </para>

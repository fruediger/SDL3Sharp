# SDL3\#

SDL3# will be a language binding for C# around [sdl3](https://www.libsdl.org/).

In contrary to the ["official" language binding for C# (SDL3-CS)](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL3-CS) listed on [the website of the SDL project](https://www.libsdl.org/languages.php), this one aims to be more "csharpier" while still offering (almost) all of the features of SDL.

**This project is currently *WORK IN PROGRESS* and is *NOT* at all usable!**

## State

I actually started this project quite some time ago (half a year iirc), but I had to stop working on it a rather short time after I started because of some health issue. So the current state of this project is mostly the state I abandoned it in back then.

While I'm currently not quite recovered, I want to start working on this project again quite shortly. In the meantime, this repository is meant to be conservative and to preserve the current progress of the project.
(That also means that there's most certainly some unwanted/unneeded stuff in here, as it's just a preservation of the current state - I apologize for that)

If this repository is helpful to inspire someone or someone else wants to work on it, I'll be very happy.
